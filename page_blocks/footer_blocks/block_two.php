    <p style="text-align:justify;">The raw data has been taken from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/" target="new" style="text-decoration:underline; color:rgba(107, 77, 112, 0.99);">WORLDOMETERS.INFO</a>. I do not post every bit of Tom, Dick and Harry piece of data - you can do that for yourselves at <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/" target="new" style="text-decoration:underline; color:rgba(107, 77, 112, 0.99);">WORLDOMETERS.INFO</a>. I have cherry picked a few points to see if the data was veracious, and on the surface it appears to be. As an example: the source for Sweden's numbers is pretty damn solid, which you can see <a href="https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa" target="new">here</a>.

    <p>In the studies linked to below you will find different estimates for percentages of individuals who will contract COVID and never be symptomatic: ergo, those individuals who have natural immunity even on the first instance of infection.</p>
    <p><strong>Whether you like it or not - whether you <em><u>want</u></em> to believe it or not, some people have better immune systems than you have</strong>. there are those among us who never get flu shots (ever!) and rarely, if ever, contract the flu. Natural immunity is a biological fact!</p>
    <p>The average from these studies are what is used as the coefficient by which all officially reported cases are increased; right now that coefficient stands at 39.6%. So, 100 offical cases will be extrapolated to be 139(ish) cases for the purposes of this data and these graphs.
