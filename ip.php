But please retain a spec of perspective: You're taking about squashing human rights... CRUSHING human rights.... for what risk? What risks are the aggregated risks of covid? Aggregated risks are the only risks to be considered in public policy: individual risks are not valid. So what are the aggregated risks? 

Let's talk about the good old USA: Of 'known' cases, ignoring asymptomatic cases, and including all the shitty methods of counting fatalities.... 98.4% of patients recover. Now to be ethical, you ought to consider asymptomatic and/or undocumented cases when considering survivability. There are estimates in different studies which range from 20% to all the way up to 80% of individuals infected could be asymptomatic. So then we're talking about a survivability percentage of between 98.6% to 99.1% survivability. 

That is really bizarre. Individuals take care of their own health decisions. Individuals do not disseminate their individual choices on a population.

Look - every life lost to an infectious disease is an individual tragedy - absolutely. But public policy is for the public - not individuals. And the facts are that a overwhelming majority of the public are not at significant risk from covid.

In what other scenario do we think it's justified to reduce the human rights of the astonishing majority of a population for the sake of the incredible minority? 

Side note: if you chose not to get vaccined - then you got covid and you got severely ill - please spare me the regret pity-party video. The reality is that these are the small minority of cases, you rolled the dice and you had really bad luck, and for that it's super unfortunate for you as an individual.
